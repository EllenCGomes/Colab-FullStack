## About
**Fullstack vacancy - Selection Process - Colab** 

**Built with:** React and Node

**Project Goal: **
- Build a web interface where it shows a list of users, fetched from https://randomuser.me/ API

**Notes and Observations: **
- I decided to develop this interface using React and Node, which are the technologies I'm learning at the moment and I'd like to put them into practice with an external project to the course I'm taking in order to analyze my development.
React's component-based approach greatly simplifies code development and maintenance, and I personally feel that even understanding is made easier.
For the server, Node, along with Axios and its simple syntax, allowed me to integrate with the external API in an easier and more organized way.
I enjoyed integrating an external API since it is a process extremely used and it allows me to work with real data and practice abstracting the information I consider relevant.
Thinking about possible integration errors with the API, creating the backend architecture and taking care of the page responsiveness were challenging at times and made me self-aware of the points I need to focus on in my studies.
